RAGBase is an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation framework designed to enhance your AI applications with multi-source knowledge retrieval capabilities. Built to operate locally or with cloud-based models, RAGBase creates a seamless pipeline between your data and large language models.
Overview

RAGBase provides a modular, extensible solution for building RAG systems with multiple retrieval agents targeting different knowledge sources. By leveraging vector databases and optimized embeddings, RAGBase delivers highly relevant context to your LLM, resulting in more accurate, knowledge-grounded responses.

The system operates through two main phases:

    Data Preparation & Indexing: Processing various data sources into searchable vector embeddings

    Retrieval & Generation: Dynamically fetching relevant information and generating responses when users ask questions11

Key Features

    Triple-Agent Retrieval System: Specialized agents for source code, documentation, and conversation history4

    Multiple LLM Interfaces: Seamless integration with NVIDIA NIM services and Ollama for local model deployment10

    Fully Customizable Pipelines: Configure every aspect of the RAG workflow from chunking to prompt engineering8

    Scalable Architecture: Built to handle everything from personal projects to enterprise-scale applications5

    Privacy-Focused: Process sensitive data locally without external API calls when using Ollama integration

    Comprehensive Evaluation: Built-in metrics for measuring retrieval quality and response accuracy7

Architecture

RAGBase follows a modular architecture with separate components for:

    Document Processing: Extract, clean, and chunk text from various sources

    Vector Embedding: Convert text into numerical representations using configurable embedding models

    Vector Storage: Index and store embeddings for efficient similarity search

    Retrieval Agents: Specialized components to extract relevant information based on query context

    LLM Interface: Connect to either NVIDIA NIM services or local Ollama models

    Response Generator: Combine retrieved information with the query to produce accurate answers27

Retrieval Agents

RAGBase implements three specialized retrieval agents:

    Source Code Retriever: Intelligently navigates codebases to extract relevant functions, classes, and implementation details. Optimized for understanding code semantics beyond simple keyword matching.

    README Doc Retriever: Specializes in extracting high-level project information, setup instructions, and usage examples from documentation. Particularly valuable for understanding project architecture and intent.

    Conversation Document Retriever: Maintains and indexes past interactions, allowing the system to reference previous questions and answers for improved context awareness and continuity.49

Each agent can operate independently or in concert, with the system automatically determining which knowledge sources are most relevant to each query.
